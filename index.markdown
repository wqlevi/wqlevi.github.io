## About me

I'm currently a Ph.D. student at Universität Tübingen and Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. My current research focus is generative models using deep learning methods(e.g. GAN, score-match model, etc.) and its application on Medical Image data, especially MRI(~9.4Tesla). I was mainly educated in major of Mechanical Engineering in Hongkong Polytechnic University.
