Hi! I'm Qi Wang, a PhD student at university of Tuebingen and working as graduate researcher in Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. I'm mainly interested in techniques that improves quality or boost performance of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, meaning post-processing and data acquisition period.//

I'm currently applying Deep Learning to improve image quality, e.g. super resolution, as well as understanding the interpretability of neural networks.
